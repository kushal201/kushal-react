Class Based Components is an older way of coding components. This was used before functional components.

class based components are JS classes and they can be identified as a component by
extending React.component. It is a class present in React package.


Inside the class we have a method named rended which will return the JSX code on the UI which we require.

The constructor method is a special method that gets called when an instance of the class is created. In the context of a React component,
it is used to initialize the component's state and bind event handlers.

in class components, for using state we use this.state and state cannot be update directly in class components

to change state, we use this.setState() inside the component. as we are clicking the button to display the change in
count value, we use onClick handler to trigger the change in state.

When an instance of a class is created, the constructor is called.

In A class component, first the constructor is called, then the render method is called and then 
componentDidMount method is called.

If more than one instance of the child class is called, then the parent constructor and render will be called
and the first child's constructor and render will be called followed by second child's constructor and render.

then first child's componentDidMount gets called followed by second child's componentDidMount, then the parent
componentDidMount gets called.

after render is called, the DOM gets updated.

For API calls in class components, make the componentDidMount method async, put the api url and create
another object this.setState to update the state variable.

after state is updated, the component re-renders again with the latest value of state variable.

componentDidUpdate method is called when the component is updated in the DOM 
and componentWillUnmount is called after component is removed from the DOM.
