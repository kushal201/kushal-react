It is advisable to make a new folder for all the created components to make sure code is readable and not everything
will fall under the root level of the code.

Also, we need to export the component in order to be accessible in the App.js file

For exporting use "export default component-name" syntax

For importing use "import component-name from path-directory"

in a component file, only one export statement is allowed

to export multiple files, we can use "named export" i.e. add export keyword before the element/component you want to export

while importing named exports, wrap that particular element in curly braces


React Hooks: 
in the current project, while writing the filter logic, we can observe when we click the button, we do get the
filtered restaurants in the conosle, but to have the same change on the UI, it is not happening.

Here is where we use Hooks, it is a plain JS utlity function,

the useState() hook and useEffect() hooks are very important.

useState() generates super powerful state variables, it's scope is usually within a component

whenever state variable updates, react re-renders the component, this is used to keep the data layer
and UI in sync.
