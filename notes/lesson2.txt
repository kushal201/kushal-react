There are two types of packages 

1. Dev dependencies
2. Normal dependeny

A dev dependeny is required in the development phase, whereas a Normal dependeny can be used in production

We have added the parcel dependency as a development dependency in the current project.

We get the parcel version after it is installed in the package.json

if the version starts with caret "^", will update you to all future minor/patch versions, without incrementing the major version.

whereas the tilde "~" version will update you to all future minor/patch versions, without incrementing the minor version.

package.json is the configuration file for the project and keeps track of all the changes.

package-lock.json keeps track of the exact version of all the dependencies and records it

node modules contains all the code that is fetched from npm. It is a collection of dependencies.

with package.json and package-lock.json, we can recreate all the node modules even if we delete it, 
by using "npm install" command.

it is not necessary to push the node modules into github, the unnecessary files can be put in the .gitignore file to
put the unnecessary files.

creating React app using the CDN links is not a preferred way.


NPM generates the App.js while you build in prod, so remove the main: App.js from package.json file
