for styling of the project we are going to use Tailwind CSS.
This can enchance the existing CSS styling present in the code.
Also we are going to use styled components.
Few CSS preprocessors such as Material UI, Chakra UI, Bootstrap, 
also help us to style components as per requirement.

for installing tailwind, we need to install it via parcel.
we will be getting tailwind.config.js file and.postcssrc files for configuring.

after deleting all the existing CSS code and after adding the tailwind directives, 
the app's styling is changed completely.
