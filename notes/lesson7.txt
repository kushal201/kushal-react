In useEffect hook, the callback function will be executed everytime when component re-renders.

when there is no dependency array, then useEffect is called on every render

but when there is an empty dependency array, useEffect will be called on initial render only (just once).

when there exists something in the dependency array, useEffect will only be called everytime when the dependency
is updated.

for example if we put in btnName inside the dependency array, as while we click it everytime it changes its state
from login to logout and vice versa, useEffect will be called everytime when the state changes.


for useState, it should be declared only inside the component.
Always create state variables on the top of the code i.e. after the component code starts

Also never use hooks inside a conditional statements and loops as it will cause inconsistencies in the code.

We will start working on React Router as we will be creating multiple pages like about, contact.
we will install version 6 of react router.

inside App.js, we import createBrowserRouter from react-router-dom. the createBrowserRouter is a function
which takes in a list of paths. We will list the specified paths for About and Contact

We create this configuration, but to provide this configuration, we will have to use RouterProvider
along with createBrowserRouter.

RouterProvider will provide the routing configuration to our app.

for handling error while we input an incorrect URL, we can use errorElement property inside createBrowserRouter
and create an Error component.

the useRouteError hook is useful for handling errors as well.
while we log the useRouteError() function inside our Error.js component and we give an incorrect URL,
it will return us an object with all respective properties.

For "about" and "contact" routes, we will be providing children routes by providing the "Outlet" component.

Outlet is used in parent route elements to render their child route elements.
This allows nested UI to show up when child routes are rendered. If the parent route matched exactly, 
it will render a child index route or nothing if there is no index route.

while we try to navigate from home to about or contact using anchor tag, the whole page gets reloaded
to avoid this, we use the <Link /> tag given by react-router-dom

Basically the whole React app is treated as an SPA (single page application) which doesn't need to reload 
or refresh all the time.

there are two types of routing in react
- client side routing
- server side routing

in server side routing, we make network calls to fetch the page on to the screen. But in client side routing,
no network calls are made as the whole page is loaded all at once.

That is why a React app is treated as a single page application.

in react, we follow SPA where the components get interchanged while we choose different paths 
via client side routing.

While creating menu pages for each restaurants, we need to perform dynamic routing as there are
different items in different restaurants.

we will be creating a RestaurantMenu component under the children route and will be using 
an API call to fetch the restaurant info.

using fetch function, we get all the data of the restaurant adn further we will destructure
through the object to have a clean code.

then we iterate over each restaurant's menu using the map function which will give us each and every item
present in the menu.

<Link> tag is like a cover up for the anchor tag
