In useEffect hook, the callback function will be executed everytime when component re-renders.

when there is no dependency array, then useEffect is called on every render

but when there is an empty dependency array, useEffect will be called on initial render only (just once).

when there exists something in the dependency array, useEffect will only be called everytime when the dependency
is updated.

for example if we put in btnName inside the dependency array, as while we click it everytime it changes its state
from login to logout and vice versa, useEffect will be called everytime when the state changes.


for useState, it should be declared only inside the component.
Always create state variables on the top of the code i.e. after the component code starts

Also never use hooks inside a conditional statements and loops as it will cause inconsistencies in the code.

We will start working on React Router as we will be creating multiple pages like about, contact.
we will install version 6 of react router.

inside App.js, we import createBrowserRouter from react-router-dom. the createBrowserRouter is a function
which takes in a list of paths. We will list the specified paths for About and Contact

We create this configuration, but to provide this configuration, we will have to use RouterProvider
along with createBrowserRouter.

RouterProvider will provide the routing configuration to our app.

for handling error while we input an incorrect URL, we can use errorElement property inside createBrowserRouter
and create an Error component.

the useRouteError hook is useful for handling errors as well.
while we log the useRouteError() function inside our Error.js component and we give an incorrect URL,
it will return us an object with all respective properties
