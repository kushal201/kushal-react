in the RestaurantCategory component for building the hide and show feature for each category. for that we have 
to create a boolean state variable showItems with inital state as true.

when the variable updates to false, the items should hide from each category when we
click on the categories.

for making the items hide, in the setShowItems() function we pass in !showItems, i.e. whenever showItems 
becomes false, it will hide all the items in the selected category.

To build a feature where if one accordion or category is expanded, the other expanded categories should be
hidden is little tricky. as each category has its own state, we cannot modify state on the items list
so we will be using the parent element i.e. RestaurantMenu to manage the state.

for doing this the RestaurantCategory should not have the state variable but the RestaurantMenu should
be using it as it is the parent element. This leads us to controlled and uncontrolled components
RestaurantCategory becomes controlled component as the RestaurantMenu component controls the
RestaurantCategory component.

controlled components become stateless components because they do not have any internal
state and do not have life cycle methods and are props driven. This feature is also
called as lifting the state up.

Previously after selecting one category all the other open categories would be hidden, 
but to make the selected category also hide, a new function toggleShowIndex which has parameter "index".

toggleShowIndex function will have the setShowIndex state function which can update the index value
by checking whether the current state and desired state are same. If both are same, the category will hide
and if both are different we will see the desired category items list displayed.
