Higher order components are functions that takes in a component and
returns us another component.

We are creating a feature where each restaurant shows whether it is Recommended or not.
For that in the RestaurantCard component we will be creating the Higher order component logic.

whenever a restaurant has rating above 4.5, it needs to show a label saying Recommended.

So the Higher order component recommended will take in RestaurantCard component
as the parameter and will return another component. Here 2 return statements are needed i.e.
1 for the higher order component and another inside the first return block.

after importing it in Body.js we can render it as per the 4.5 and above rating requirement
by passing resData as props.
Also props will be a parameter in the higher order component's first return statement.

HOC are preferred as they are pure functions and do not modify existing component's code.
