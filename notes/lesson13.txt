Types of Testing a developer can do are:
- Unit Testing
- Integration Testing
- E2E Testing

Unit Testing means testing each component in isolation.
Integration testing means to test if all the components together work as a whole or not.

to start unit testing, React Testing Library is used. when an app is created using create-react-app,
testing library is already configured, but as this app is built using parcel, testing library should be
added.
