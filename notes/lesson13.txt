Types of Testing a developer can do are:
- Unit Testing
- Integration Testing
- E2E Testing

Unit Testing means testing each component in isolation.
Integration testing means to test if all the components together work as a whole or not.

to start unit testing, React Testing Library is used. when an app is created using create-react-app,
testing library is already configured, but as this app is built using parcel, testing library should be
added.

Jest is used as the testing library the project. it is a JavaScript testing library which works 
with projects using Babel, TypeScript, Node, React, Angular, Vue.

react testing library and jest are installed, also as babel is used the necessary dependencies are
also installed and is configured inside babel.config.js file.

Parcel already has babel and also has its own configuration. As we are trying to override the configuration
a conflict might arise. To avoid this we have to change configuration of parcel.
a new file .parcelrc is created to modify parcel configuration to disable default babel transpilation
and use the new configuration.

to run test cases, npm run test command is used, and while executing the command a message no tests found
appears which implies the testing library is successfully configured.

jest is configured using npx jest --init command. jsdom is used as the test environment which is also
configured.
To create test cases, a folder __tests__ is created
